# Titanic

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

Predicting if a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on data provided by Kaggle for a machine learning competition.

Still attempting to determine what data is most meaningful as I removed some data that I felt wasn't relevant for this task. (i.e. Name, Embarked, Ticket) These changes can also be seen in the code itself as I did some preprocessing within the python notebook. 

10/26/23 Update: Github reorg. A project from 2018, leaving it mostly untouched just added a link to the original data. Funny to look back at this stuff.
