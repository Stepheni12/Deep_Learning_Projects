# MNIST

Basic Tensorflow Neural Network using the MNIST dataset

Accuracy: 0.97757

The training data I used is from the Digit Recognizer Kaggle competition. Right now I'm just using a
5-layer neural network with dropout. In the future I want to implement learning rate decay on this model do see how well that improves my 
model.

Ultimately I would like to get practice on other deep learning algorithms so I could run this dataset through a CNN. I actually have the
model ready to run, however, I currently lack the computing power to train it.
