# Mini-ImageNet

This is a CNN model I developed in Keras and used to train a 10 class subset of the imagenet dataset. It's using a 3 block architecture that I've adapted to a variety of image tasks and it seems to broadly perform well.

10/26/23 Update: Github reorg. Project from 2019. At the time of this project I was using keras a lot more frequently. Looking back now it is aesthetically pleasing, but currently I'm pretty much strictly using PyTorch on projects.
