# Flappy Bird AI

Collected training data using the file called collect_data.py which records your screen as you play the online version of flappy bird (flappybird.io). 

The getkeys.py file is just a helper function which records which keys you are pressing as you are playing flappy bird and creating your training data. 

The train.py file contains a convolutional neural network developed in keras which yields a test accuracy of about 90%. The runner.py file is used to load the fully trained model and begin playing flappy bird. 

10/26/23 Update: Github reorg. This project was from 2019. I remember spending a lot of time playing flappy bird to create the training data which I've since had to delete because it took up so much space. Maybe I'll get back around to this one day, probably not though.
