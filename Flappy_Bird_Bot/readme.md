Collected training data using the file called collect_data.py which records your screen as you play the online version of flappy bird (flappybird.io). The getkeys.py file is just a helper function which records which keys you are pressing as you are playing flappy bird and creating your training data. The train.py file contains a convolutional neural network developed in keras which yields a test accuracy of about 90%. The runner.py file is used to load the fully trained model and begin playing flappy bird.
